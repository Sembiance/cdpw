So selenium sucks. It ALWAYS has. I mean totally horrible.
The last straw was the fact that the latest chrome causes issues with the NPM selenium webdriver 3.6.0
However the 4.0.0 version of the selenium webdriver (which may or may not fix the problem) has been totall rewritten.
The new way of doing this is HORRIBLE promise laden crap.
So this is just a simple wrapper around the NPM module chrome-remote-protocol that will make it easy to just control chrome directly
Goodbye selenium. You won't be missed.
